# Data-Protection-Addendum

This Bonterms Data Protection Addendum (DPA) operates as an Attachment to the [Bonterms Cloud Terms](https://github.com/Bonterms/Cloud-Terms).

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) is simplifying commercial contracting through Standard Agreements. Our enterprise Cloud Terms (with DPA and SLA Attachments), Professional Services Agreement (PSA) and Mutual NDA let the parties start from a balanced foundation and negotiate by Cover Page, not redlines. The Bonterms Platform will leverage our Standard Agreements to take collaborative dealmaking to the next level. Bonterms is lawyer-led and funded by XYZ Capital and Wilson Sonsini.

## How to Use
1. **Review** the DPA with your lawyer.
2. **Prepare** your DPA Setup Page ([example](https://bonterms.com/forms/example-dpa-setup-page/)).
- Identify the parties, DPA Effective Date, Subprocessor List and other **Key Terms**.
- Propose any **Additional Terms** (additions to or modifications of the DPA).
3. **Prepare** your Schedules ([examples](https://bonterms.com/forms/example-dpa-schedules/)).
4. **Send** your DPA Setup Page (and Schedules) to your counterparty.
5. **Negotiate** the DPA Setup Page and Schedules.
6. **Sign** the DPA Setup Page and create your **DPA**!
7. **Add** the DPA as an Attachment to the Agreement you created using the Cloud Terms.
